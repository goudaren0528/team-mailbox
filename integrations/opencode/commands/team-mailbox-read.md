Load the `team-mailbox-read` skill through the skill tool, then follow it for this
explicit message-reading request. User filters or intent: $ARGUMENTS

Single unread shortcut: only unread_only=true, a fresh first page (cursor omitted
or cursor=0), messages.length=1 and hasMore=false proves the complete matching set
is one. Unless the user explicitly requests selection, this viewing request is
enough: receive_attachment with only attachment_id successfully before the complete
body, without repeated confirmation. No shortcut in all mode, unknown completeness,
later pages or read-only/local filtering of an earlier multi-message list. After
cancel, query again for a new request; never reuse cached uniqueness. Zero matches
means no reading/download; offer all messages. Attachment failure still asks retry,
explicit skip or cancel. These are Agent instructions, not runtime enforcement.

If the skill is missing, explain that its folder must be installed in the same
OpenCode scope's skills/ directory and stop. Do not improvise a Markdown inbox list.
Reading TEST/BUGFIX/TEST_FIX/RESULT work-order messages belongs to team-mailbox-read;
do not route to dispatch merely because of TEST keywords.
Browsing multiple messages requires native question, not an assistant Markdown
candidate list or table, MCP elicitation or submit prompt. If question is unavailable,
explain the limitation and ask which alternative the user wants; never silently downgrade.
An explicit message ID with direct-read intent needs no redundant selection; follow
the skill's metadata lookup and attachment-before-body workflow for that exact ID.
Raw tool JSON may remain visible in host previews/details; do not promise to hide it.
These are Agent instructions, not runtime enforcement. Do not
install files, set MSG_DOWNLOAD_DIR, send messages or change configuration here.
